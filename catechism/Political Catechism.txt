Q. 1. What is the purpose of the Word of God?
A. The Word of God is given to us so that we may know the misery and danger of our fallen state,[1] how we may escape the judgment we deserve through its satisfaction in the person and work of Christ,[2] and how we are to govern ourselves in thankfulness and duty to God as our Savior and Creator.[3]

Q. 2. Can law be separated from religion? 
A. No. Law and religion are inseparable.[1] Legislation seeks to protect the good and punish that which subverts it, but religion must first define good and evil.[2] The source of a society's law is the god of that society.[3]

Q. 3. Is it possible for a society to be religiously neutral? 
A. No. Every law system must maintain its existence by hostility to every other law system, or else it commits suicide.[1] Toleration is simply a device used to introduce a new law system as a prelude to a new intolerance.[2]

Q. 4. Historically, what is meant by "Natural Law"?
A. Historically, Natural Law refers to a body of universal moral principles inherent in the structure of the universe and human nature, which can be discovered by human reason alone, independent of the Bible. It views the cosmos as a rational system where all people—believers and non-believers alike—can discern the difference between right and wrong simply by observing the "nature" of things.[1]

Q. 5. Biblically, how should Natural Law be understood?
A. Biblically, natural law should not be understood as a set of abstract principles existing in nature independently. Rather, it should be understood as the natural duties inherent in man's relationships[1] with God,[2] his neighbor,[3] and the earth.[4] To rightly understand these duties, God must reveal to us the true nature of these relationships as He established them.[5]

Q. 6. What is the purpose of Biblical Law? 
A. The purpose of Biblical Law is the restoration of God’s order in society, enabling the redeemed to pursue their creation mandate to subdue and exercise dominion over the earth.[1] Justice is not merely an emotional sentiment but the objective restoration of godly order.[2]

Q. 7. Are believers dead to the law? 
A. Through the vicarious death of Christ, the believer is dead to the law as an indictment and set free from the rule of sin and death;[1] but he is renewed in the image of Christ, the perfect Law-Keeper, so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in him. The law remains the revelation of God’s righteousness, and his way of holiness for us.[2]

[2] Rom. 8:4; Eph 2:10; Rom 7:12-14; Rom 3:31


Q. 8. How are we to understand the law covenantally? 
A. We are to understand the law covenantally as a treaty of grace, in which God consecrates a people to Himself by giving them a sovereignly dictated order of life, assigning them a place and a way to exercise godly dominion in the earth.[1]
[1] Exo. 19:4–6; Exo. 20:2; Rom. 9:4; 1 Pet. 2:9-12; IBL 11

Q. 9. What role does the law serve in the restoration of godly order?
A. The law teaches us God’s order for society and the restitutions owed to Him for the violation of His order. These restitutions may be divided into the restitution of theft and the retribution of abominations.

Q. 10. How are we to understand biblical law?
A. We are to understand the Ten Commandments as the declaration of the basic principles of godly order, and the sundry laws as their case law application.
Q. 11. What is the function of Case Law? 
A. Case law serves to illustrate the basic principles of the commandments by providing specific, often minimal, examples. By defining the law in a particular instance, it reveals the necessary jurisdiction of the principle and prevents man from restricting God’s law to a limited human definition that denies its full intended application.

Q. 12. How are we to use Case Law?
A. Following the biblical example, we are to develop the implications of the basic principle shown through its case law, applying them to every aspect of life for the restoration of God’s order in society.
Q. 13. What is civil government? 
A. Civil government is an ordinance of God established for the restoration of godly order by the retribution of crimes and the enforcement of restitution.
Q. 14. What is the distinction between a "sin" and a "crime"? 
A. A sin is any transgression of God's law. A crime is a sin that disrupts godly order in society. God requires the civil government to exercise restitution for crimes according to the law.
